### S3 Reference
<details>
 
[DIY _ Mounting S3 on local filesystem using S3FS-FUSE .pdf](https://github.com/risarora/Greatlake-ccp/files/6279920/DIY._.Mounting.S3.on.local.filesystem.using.S3FS-FUSE.pdf)

#### S3 Transition options

<details>
You can add rules in an S3 Lifecycle configuration to tell Amazon S3 to transition objects to another Amazon S3 storage class. For example:

When you know that objects are infrequently accessed, you might transition them to the S3 Standard-IA storage class.

You might want to archive objects that you don't need to access in real time to the S3 Glacier storage class.

In an S3 Lifecycle configuration, you can define rules to transition objects from one storage class to another to save on storage costs. When you don't know the access patterns of your objects, or your access patterns are changing over time, you can transition the objects to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class for automatic cost savings.

#### Mounting S3 on local filesystem
<details>
Any application interacting with the mounted drive doesnâ€™t have to worry about transfer protocols, security mechanisms, or Amazon S3-specific API calls. In some cases, mounting Amazon S3 as drive on an application server can make creating a distributed file store extremely easy.

For example, when creating a photo upload application, you can have it store data on a fixed path in a file system and when deploying you can mount an Amazon S3 bucket on that fixed path. This way, the application will write all files in the bucket without you having to worry about Amazon S3 integration at the application level. Another major advantage is to enable legacy applications to scale in the cloud since there are no source code changes required to use an Amazon S3 bucket as storage backend: the application can be configured to use a local path where the Amazon S3 bucket is mounted. This technique is also very helpful when you want to collect logs from various servers in a central location for archiving.

S3FS-FUSE: This is a free, open-source FUSE plugin and an easy-to-use utility which supports major Linux distributions & MacOS. S3FS also takes care of caching files locally to improve performance. This plugin simply shows the Amazon S3 bucket as a drive on your system.

Important - Generally S3 cannot offer the same performance or semantics as a local file system.

This is for additional reference only.
