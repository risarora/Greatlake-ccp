### AWS Well Architected Framework
AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications and workloads. Based on five pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization — AWS Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that can scale over time.

### Cloud Governance by The Open Group
The objective of this Snapshot is to specify a framework for cloud computing governance. This Snapshot documents a proposal for a standard Cloud Computing Governance Framework.
The traditional non-cloud computing governance frameworks (e.g., ITIL® v3, COBIT® 5, the TOGAF® 9.1 standard, and the SOA Governance Framework) are general and do not provide governance around systems that support cloud characteristics (e.g., elasticity). They also do not sufficiently take into account the fact that, with cloud computing, the question of division of responsibilities between user and supplier of IT services becomes completely different and very important.

### Site Reliability Engineering @Google (SRE)
Google’s Approach to Service Management: Site Reliability Engineering
Conflict isn’t an inevitable part of offering a software service. Google has chosen to run our systems with a different approach: our Site Reliability Engineering teams focus on hiring software engineers to run our products and to create systems to accomplish the work that would otherwise be performed, often manually, by sysadmins.
