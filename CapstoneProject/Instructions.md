## Complete any 2 use cases given under “Capstone use cases” module

* Each use case is for 20 points. Total 40 points.

Each use case report should have following sections:

Sections | Points

**TOTAL (for 1 use case) | 20**

 

Do NOT use AWS Educate starter account, as you may get some road blocks due to service restrictions for starter account. Complete it in a separate free tier account.
